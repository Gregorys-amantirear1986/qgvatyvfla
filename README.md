Man, just stepped out and I’m telling you my head’s all over the place. Warfare was like—woosh—an explosion of colors and sounds, like someone took every loud tattoo gun ever and just cranked it up in the galaxy. The theater, dude... popcorn crumbs EVERYWHERE. That kind of sticky floor sensation under your feet that feels like a bad decision—like that one time I tried to tattoo in dim light.

> So there's this scene, right, where the sky is on fire, helicopters buzzing like angry hornets, and you can't tell if the heat on your face is from the movie or the dude next to you who had that one too many Taco Bell specials. The seat was digging into my back, probably 20 years old or something, felt like I was leaning against a wall of cold needles—sharp and relentless.

And then, somewhere in the middle of this cinematic chaos, your mind just zigzags to shouldn't I download the movie later? Like, ugh I suddenly remember—you ever get that feeling, you’re not even sure where you are, your mind just skips to the next scene before your body's ready. One second bullets are flying, the next, BAM, you’re thinking about how to watch the movie again later, without the guy snoring two rows back like a goddamn chainsaw.

Fragmented characters though, like shards of glass reflecting little bits of truth. The lead character, what’s his face... Jack? Jake? He moves like smoke, shifting through the shadows faster than a needle in skin. And those eyes, man, looked like they held all the world’s secrets, or maybe just a really shitty past. You know, like something you can’t wipe off, even with the best cleaner.

Also, could totally see myself ink the battle scenes, crazy detailed sleeves coming to life, tanks morphing into dragons maybe. Blurring the lines, you know? Like reality’s just trying too hard. The sound was a goddamn avalanche, my ears weren't just ringing, they were screaming. Reminded me of that time I left a tattoo stencil on too long, ghost images imprinting themselves into your brain.

-> Wait, wait. Almost forgot the end credits were rolling, and I got this random thought, I EVER tell you ‘bout Jim’s tattoo party when we watched some bootleg stuff? This wasn’t that. It's raw, it’s like holding an electric charge. I'm buzzed. 

Anyway, gotta shake it off, or not. The buzz is kinda nice. Oh, hey, no idea if someone already asked but, you thinking to download the movie? Makes you wanna dive in again without the sticky floors or, you know, the guy who lost the battle against sleep.

```c
// Don't know how this got here but whatever
int main() {
    printf(Hello, Explosion!
);
    return 0;
